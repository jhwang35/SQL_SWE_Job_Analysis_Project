# Introduction
Welcome to the SQL Data Job Analysis Project! This repository is dedicated to exploring and analyzing job market trends within the data industry using SQL. This project focuses on software engineer roles, exploring top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and most optimal skills based data that connects the salary with demand.

# Background
To better understand today's rapidly evolving job market, this project was created to explore the required skills to be successful within it. Navigating this dynamic landscape can be challenging due to the abundance of job postings and varying requirements across different sectors and this project aims to make the data more accessible.

Data is from [Luke Barousse's](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql) SQL tutorial. Gives information on salary, location, job titles, and skills for computer science related jobs.

### Questions to answer through SQL queries:
1. What are the top-paying software engineer jobs?
2. What are the skills required for a top-paying software engineer job?
3. What skills are most in demand for a software engineer?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools Used
The following tools were instrumental in completing this project
- **SQL:** Allowed me to query through data to search for keypoints and answer my questions.
- **PostgreSQL:** An open-source database system, robust and scalable platform for managing larger datasets.
- **VSCode:** The primary IDE for writing and editing SQL scripts. Streamlined the development process and enhanced productivity.
- **Git & GitHub:** Git was used for version control, enabling efficient management of code changes and collaboration. GitHub provided a platform for hosting the project repository, facilitating version tracking, issue management, and collaborative development.
# Analysis

### 1. Top Paying Remote Software Engineer Jobs
To identify the top-paying Software Engineer positions, I filtered the job title to "Software Engineer," specified the search criteria to include only remote opportunities, and then sorted the results by salary.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Software Engineer' AND 
    job_work_from_home = True AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
## Breakdown ##
- The highest paying job is for a Senior Software Engineer at Datavant, with an average yearly salary of $225,000.
- Senior Software Engineer roles are consistently among the highest paid, with various specializations such as Full Stack, Cluster Scalability, and Server Security.
- Leading companies like MongoDB, Pulley, and Webflow offer competitive salaries, often around or above $190,000 per year for senior and staff engineer positions.

### 2. Top Paying Software Engineer Job Skills
To determine the skills linked with the highest-paying Software Engineer jobs, I used a Common Table Expression (CTE) to reference the top-paying positions and then associated the skill names with their corresponding skill IDs.


```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE job_title_short = 'Software Engineer' AND 
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY 
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*, --selects all columns from top_paying_jobs table
    skills -- from skills dim table
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id -- joins the job id's together 
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id -- allows us to access skill name and type
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```
## Breakdown ##
- Python and Java are the most common in software engineering jobs because of their effectiveness in application development.
- JavaScript, React, and Node.js are commonly used in full-stack development.
- Since the cloud is becoming more important for its capabilites in scalable hosting, continuous integration, and storage jobs that work with the cloud are paid more.

### 3. Top Demanded Software Engineer Skills
Determining the most demanded Software Engineer skills was straightforward. I used a count aggregate function to identify which skills appeared most frequently and then sorted them by their demand count.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id -- joins the job id's together 
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id -- allows us to access skill name and type
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Software Engineer' AND (job_work_from_home = True OR  job_location = 'Chicago, IL')
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY 
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
## Breakdown ##
- Programming languages are high in demand along with cloud skills
- Kubernetes is important for software engineers to manage applications deployment on a larger scale

    | Skill       | Demand Count |
    |-------------|--------------|
    | Python      | 1328         |
    | SQL         | 1056         |
    | AWS         | 1014         |
    | Java        | 746          |
    | Kubernetes  | 619          |
    *Table of the most in demand skills*

### 4. Top Paying Software Engineer Skills
The analysis of top-paying skills built upon the previous query by sorting the results based on average salary. To present cleaner salary figures, the average salary was rounded using the **ROUND** function.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills, 
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary -- 0 indicates how many decimal places we round to 
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id -- joins the job id's together 
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id -- allows us to access skill name and type
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Software Engineer' 
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 
    skills
ORDER BY 
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
## Breakdown ##
- Skills in NoSQL databases such as Cassandra, Couchbase, and DynamoDB are highly valued, reflecting the industry's shift towards flexible, scalable data management solutions.
- Skills related to cloud platforms and services (Aurora, AWS, Atlassian) indicate a strong demand for professionals who can manage and deploy applications in the cloud.
- Traditional languages like C and Assembly remain valuable for system-level programming, while modern languages like Go, Julia, and Clojure are gaining traction for their performance and simplicity.

### 5. Most Optimal Skills
The most optimal skills were determined by integrating the results of all queries. This involved using multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to connect the skills with the highest demand to those with the highest salaries.


```sql
WITH skills_demand AS (
    SELECT 
        skills_dim.skill_id,
        skills_dim.skills,
        COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id -- joins the job id's together 
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id -- allows us to access skill name and type
    WHERE 
        job_title_short = 'Software Engineer' 
        AND job_work_from_home = True
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        skills_dim.skill_id
    ), 
    
average_salary AS ( -- separate CTEs with a comma using the same with command for both
    SELECT 
        skills_job_dim.skill_id,
        ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary -- 0 indicates how many decimal places we round to 
    FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id -- joins the job id's together 
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id -- allows us to access skill name and type
    WHERE 
        job_title_short = 'Software Engineer' 
        AND job_work_from_home = True
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        skills_job_dim.skill_id
)

SELECT 
    skills_demand.skill_id,
    skills_demand.skills,
    demand_count,
    avg_salary
FROM
    skills_demand
INNER JOIN average_salary ON skills_demand.skill_id = average_salary.skill_id
ORDER BY 
    demand_count DESC,
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

## Breakdown ##
- Programming languages such as python and javascript are high in demand and salary for web development
- Database management systems such as SQL are still valuable for accessing and storing data
- As a result of cloud platforms growing and opportunities that they provide, skills in cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure are highly sought after skills.
